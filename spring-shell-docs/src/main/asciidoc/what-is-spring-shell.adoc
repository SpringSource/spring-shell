== What is Spring Shell?

Not all applications need a fancy web user interface!
Sometimes, interacting with an application using an interactive terminal is
the most appropriate way to get things done.

Spring Shell allows one to easily create such a runnable application, where the
user will enter textual commands that will get executed until the program terminates.
The Spring Shell project provides the infrastructure to create such a REPL (Read, Eval,
Print Loop), allowing the developer to concentrate on the commands implementation, using
the familiar Spring programming model.

Advanced features such as parsing, completion, colorization of output, fancy ascii-art
table display, input conversion and validation all come for free, with the developer only
having to focus on core command logic.
